This repository provides datasets and additional information for the paper "Technical Debt Management Based on Issues in OSS Development: An Empirical Study on GitHub."

There are three datasets: DS1, DS2, and DS3.

DS1 contains TD issues' basic items after data cleaning, and label events and comment events related to these TD issues.

DS2 covers the TD type of each TD issue and the quality attribute affected by the TD issue.

DS3 contains information about selected repositories, as well as basic items and reopened events of resolved TD and non-TD issues of these repositories.

In addition, the repository also provides the set of candidate TD labels to search TD issues in the paper (shown in TDlabelsChosen.csv) and the enumeration of the relationship between issue reporters and the repository (shown in RepoRelation.csv).
